\frametitle{Outline}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Theory 
  \item Conventional mediation
  \item Causal estimands
  \item Mediation with post-treatment confounding
  \item R examples: mediation using \emph{CMAverse} and \emph{paths}
  \item Advanced topics in mediation: multiple mediators, path-specific effects, time-varying and cumulative estimands
  \item Theory 
\end{enumerate}

---

\frametitle{Background}

>- A central aim in sociological and demographic analysis is \emph{explaining} the source of differences.

>- We love to theorize mechanisms: Why is X related to Y?

>- Quant studies: \emph{“It looks like there is an effect of X on Y, but it goes away when I control for M”}

---

\frametitle{Background}

>- But quantitative causal mediation is really hard and requires tons of assumptions - \bf{theoretically}, not just implementation.

>- Most modern methodological developments explore relatively simple use cases. 

>- Should we do it anyway?

\frametitle{Causal inference}

>- Causal inference in the potential outcomes tradition:

>- \emph{Instrument-based}: assumptions revolve around validity of instrument; direct randomization to treatment is the most plausible instrument.

>- \emph{Confounder-control}: assumptions revolve around unmeasured confounding.

>- Mediation analysis with instrument-based methods is very hard. There are people working on study designs ("crossover designs"), but I’m not going to talk about this. See Imai, Tingley and Yamamoto (2013, JRSS-A).

\frametitle{Causal mediation}

>- “Post-treatment confounding” or “exposure-induced mediator-outcome confounding.”

>- Best description of this is Wodtke, Harding, & Elwert (2011, ASR).

>- This is impossible to handle with Baron-Kenny mediation. You’ll likely always overestimate the proportion of the total effect that is mediated.  

>- Requires “g-methods”: IPTW (weighting) or g-formula (impute counterfactuals). See Naimi, Cole, & Kennedy (2016, IJE): An introduction to g-methods.

>- New counterfactual quantities! These estimands contain the value the mediator would take "naturally" under treatment or no treatment.

>- This gets us closer to methods for "demographic decomposition", a connection I'll talk about at the end. For example, what would rates of college attainment look like for folks racialized as Black if they had the same distribution of parental income as those racialized as white? What would the crude mortality rate look like for Mexico if it had the same age structure as the US?

\frametitle{Interactions}

>- What about interactions? What if they effect of M on Y \emph{depends} on treatment? Consider the Black-white income example I just gave. 

>- We can handle treatment-mediator interactions in VanderWeele's (2014) 4-way decomposition.

\frametitle{Estimation notes}

>- Randomized analogues

>- Stochastic controlled direct effects

>- The "cross world independence assumption": there is an independence between counterfactual outcome and mediator values “across worlds,” with one being a world in which the exposure is set to A = a for the outcome and the other being a world in which it is set to A = a' for the mediator. Such an exposure assignment cannot occur in real life, making the cross-world independence assumption impossible to verify, even in principle, without relying on other equally problematic assumptions (see Andrews & Didelez, 2021, Epidemiology).

---

\frametitle{Estimation notes}

>- But aren't we just imputing values to consider different counterfactual contrasts? Are we really doing anything \emph{causal}? Is this just "surgery of equations?" 

>- Is demographic decomposition ever causal? See Sudharsanan & Bijlsma (2022, IJE).

>- \emph{My take}: mechanisms are important, and we can use mediation analysis to rule out theoretical alternatives and use a holistic view of "inference to best explanation." Baron-Kenny mediation is bad, but "causal mediation" in the strict potential outcomes sense will probably never meet its own assumptions. Something in the middle, paying attention to complex post-treatment dynamics and combined with good theory, can be useful.
